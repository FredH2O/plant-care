# React & Material-UI Practice Project

This project is a practice application designed to explore and apply key **React** concepts and **Material-UI** components. It's an excellent example of a beginner-to-intermediate project, focusing on modern React development and UI styling using Material-UI.

## Features

- **React Concepts**:
  - Functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.).
  - Component composition and props.
  - State management and event handling.
  - Form handling with validation.
- **Material-UI Integration**:
  - Responsive layouts with Material-UI's `Grid` and `Box`.
  - Styled components using Material-UI's `sx` prop.
  - Customizable and accessible `Modal`, `Button`, and `Typography` components.
  - Animations and transitions with Material-UI's `Fade` and `Grow`.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
Optimizes the React application for the best performance.

## Learning Goals

### React

- Practice state management with `useState` and explore conditional rendering.
- Work with forms and input validation in a React application.
- Understand and implement reusable components.

### Material-UI

- Learn to create professional-looking UIs with Material-UI.
- Customize components using the `sx` prop for dynamic styling.
- Add animations to UI components with `Fade` and `Grow`.

---

## How It Works

### Components

1. **Contact Form**:

   - A simple form where users can input their full name, email, and a message.
   - Uses Material-UI's `TextField` for inputs and a `Button` for submission.

2. **Modal Component**:
   - Displays a confirmation message when the form is submitted.
   - Includes a fade-in animation for a polished user experience.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: Core library for building the UI.
- **Material-UI**: For creating accessible, responsive, and customizable components.

## Deployment

To deploy the project to a hosting platform, build the project first:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then, follow the platform-specific instructions (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages).
